All files created with python 3.6.4


singleTest.py, suite.py, and geneticAlgorithm.py are all wrapers for pacman.py

singleTest.py takes an input file and passes it to pacman, printing pacman.s output

suite.py runs all test* files on the pacman function

geneticAlgorithm.py can be passed an input file.  It will then ignore that input file's path and
attempt to calculate the optimal path to collect all of the coins.
